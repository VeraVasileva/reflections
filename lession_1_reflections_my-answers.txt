Command 'diff' is very useful command for finding bugs when we speak about two versions of a file.

Easy access to the entire history of a file help to refresh all changes made in it during its creation.
Also it helps to find typos or information which have been deleted.

The big pros in manual commits is to choose when to do it. Because only author of the document may say when he or she logically finished editing.

Version control systems allow saving multiple files in ome commit because you use manual saving.

Git log command show a list of recent commits with information about them including commit IDs. 
Git diff allow to compare to commits, i.e. what was changed (deleted and added)

You may do checkouts.
