git init - initialize empty directory. Эта команда создаёт в текущем каталоге новый подкаталог с именем .git содержащий все необходимые файлы репозитория — основу Git-репозитория.

Master branch is a production branch and you can create DEV branch.

The diagrams visualize the branch structure and we can see what commits were made in each branch.

The result of merging two branches together is a union of two documents which were edited by different people.
